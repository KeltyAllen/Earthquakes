Earthquake cluster analysis

main file is earthquakeclustering.py, some useful methods are in data_analysis_tools
useful clustering happened using dbscan primarily, and kmeans somewhat

affprop stuff is trying out affinity propagation, which was too slow to be practical for the size of the data

clusteranalysis.py is for comparing clusters to omori-utsu law and gutenberg-richter law
